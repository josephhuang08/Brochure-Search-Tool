# Supermarket Discount Brochure Search Tool

This project aims to create a tool that allows users to search for items in various supermarket discount brochures. When the user performs a search, the tool will output a list of matching searched items from the brochures and display pictures along with prices and discounts. This information will assist the user to save money on their groceries.  

This will be a Subscription-based service. The target customers will be Chinese students in Chemnitz. To access the service there will be a monthly or annual fee.  

The service may be presented as a website, WeChat mini-program, or chatbot.
